"""
This game is inspired by a job interview test reported by Johannes Pausch.

You have a (infinitly - here finite) horizontal field and try to connect k points.
Each player takes turns to add their stones. In contrast to classical connect-4, stones are added beneeth existing stones and push up the stones of the collumn.
